# SPARC for VSCode README

Syntax highlighing and code snippets for SPARC Assembly in VSCode. Specifically designed for SPARC V9, but should be backwards-compatible.

Credit to Austin Anderson (ProtractorNinja) for the original SPARC tmLanguage file for the Sublime text editor. You can find his original code at https://github.com/ProtractorNinja/SPARC-sublime.

## Known Issues

For strings/labels in between parentheses, the left parenthesis is colored when it shouldn't be. I'm not able to get it to work so if you know how to fix it feel free to submit a pull request.

Not all instructions/directives have snippets; only the most frequently encountered ones do. If more are desired, create an issue and I'll add them.

### Release Notes:

1.0.0: Initial release of the extension.
